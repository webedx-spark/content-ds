# Data App Template Repository
If you're looking to generate a new Data App, please do so on the [Retool Data App Setup form](https://retool.coursera.org/apps/edc1a370-5e4d-11ee-ac31-8720b69cf398/Developer%20Experience/Data%20Application%20Setup).

This repository is for the dev-tools library setup usage only, and has many sharp-corners for humans.

## Description
This project is a collection of data app and libs templates that will be used for application setup.

This consists of a collection of templates under `/*-template/` dirs.
